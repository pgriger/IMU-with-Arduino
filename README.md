# IMU-with-Arduino
Program for ArduinoUNO to print measured values from GY-80 10DOF IMU to serial line. Module measures acceleration in three axis, turn rate in three axis, magnetic induction in three axis, temperature, pressure and altitude.  Program was created as a part of a school project in 2015.

Components of GY-80:
 - Accelerometer ADXL345
 - Gyroscope L3G4200D
 - Magnetometer HMC5883L
 - Barometer BMP085
